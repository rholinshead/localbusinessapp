A basic iPhone app for a local business. Updates to (hopefully follow)

This is a very basic iPhone app made in my spare time with the help of several tutorials. I intend to update the app
when I get enough free time to do so. 

Intended Updates:
1. Add a new View Controller with a Segue allowing the user to tap a photo in the CatalogViewController to zoom in
and see a text description of the item (in the new view controller, CatalogItemViewController).
2. Use dynamic photos and text descriptions from a personal website, wherein the business owner posts their pictures 
and text and the app parses the info to show to the app user. Will probably have to set up an API to do so, as well as
purchase a domain and set up a website that allows users (business owners) to log in and upload content to be used 
b the app
3. Overall revamp the look of the app (add better Segue techniques such as a top navigation bar)
